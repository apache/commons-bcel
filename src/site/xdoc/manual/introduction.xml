  <section name="Introduction">
    <p>
      The <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> language has become
      very popular and many research projects deal with further
      improvements of the language or its run-time behavior. The
      possibility to extend a language with new concepts is surely a
      desirable feature, but the implementation issues should be hidden
      from the user. Fortunately, the concepts of the Java Virtual
      Machine permit the user-transparent implementation of such
      extensions with relatively little effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the target language of Java is an interpreted language
      with a small and easy-to-understand set of instructions (the
      <em>byte code</em>), developers can implement and test their
      concepts in a very elegant way. One can write a plug-in
      replacement for the system's <em>class loader</em> which is
      responsible for dynamically loading class files at run-time and
      passing the byte code to the Virtual Machine (see section ).
      Class loaders may thus be used to intercept the loading process
      and transform classes before they get actually executed by the
      JVM. While the original class files always remain unaltered, the
      behavior of the class loader may be reconfigured for every
      execution or instrumented dynamically.

      The <font face="helvetica,arial">BCEL</font> API (Byte Code
      Engineering Library), formerly known as JavaClass, is a toolkit
      for the static analysis and dynamic creation or transformation of
      Java class files. It enables developers to implement the desired
      features on a high level of abstraction without handling all the
      internal details of the Java class file format and thus
      re-inventing the wheel every time. <font face="helvetica,arial">BCEL
    </font> is written entirely in Java and freely available under the

      This manual is structured as follows: We give a brief description
      of the Java Virtual Machine and the class file format in <a
            href="jvm.html">section 2</a>. <a href="bcel-api.html">Section 3</a> 
      introduces the <font face="helvetica,arial">BCEL</font> API.
      <a href="application-areas.html">Section 4</a> describes some typical 
      application areas and example projects. The appendix contains code examples
      that are to long to be presented in the main part of this paper. All examples
      are included in the down-loadable distribution.
