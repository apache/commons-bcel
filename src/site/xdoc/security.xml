      <subsection name="CVE-2022-42920">
        <ul>
          <li>CVE-2022-42920: Apache Commons BCEL prior to 6.6.0 allows producing arbitrary bytecode via out-of-bounds writing.</li>
          <li>Severity: Critical</li>
          <li>CWE-ID: CWE-787</li>
          <li>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</li>
          <li>Versions Affected: Apache Commons BCEL before 6.6.0.</li>
          <li>Description: Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an
            out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass
            attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache
            Commons BCEL 6.6.0.
          </li>
          <li>Mitigation: Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.6.0 or later, which fixes the issue.</li>
